About the Project<br>
I built this as a way to practice basic game logic and working with the HTML5 Canvas API. It is written in plain code without any external libraries or engines.<br>
<br>
Key features:<br>
Standard player vs. computer gameplay.<br>
Ball physics that change based on where it hits the paddle.<br>
Basic score tracking for both sides.<br>
<br>
How to Run Locally<br>
If you want to run this on your machine, you can simply download the tennisGame.html file from this repository and open it in any web browser. <br>
